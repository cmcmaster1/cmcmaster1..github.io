20056	The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) agents for all phases of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Where the term TKI agent appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to dasatinib or nilotinib. Imatinib mesilate is not approved for use in second or third line treatment.Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only one of dasatinib or nilotinib at any one time and must not be receiving concomitant interferon alfa therapy. Eligible patients may only swap between these agents if they have not failed prior PBS-subsidised treatment with that agent.Nilotinib is not approved for patients in blast crisis.1. Initial second line treatmentFrom 1 April 2012, under the PBS, a patient will be able to be prescribed either dasatinib or nilotinib within the initial 18 month treatment period as second-line therapy, as long as only one agent is approved at a time and providing the patient did not fail that drug as first-line therapy.During the initial 18 month treatment period, switching between approved second-line agents may only occur for reasons of intolerance, not failure of response.2. Initial third line treatmentThird-line treatment with a TKI can only be approved when imatinib is used for first-line treatment. Patients will only be approved for PBS-subsidised treatment with one third-line agent.From 1 April 2012, under the PBS, a patient will be able to be prescribed either dasatinib or nilotinib providing the patient did not fail that drug as first or second line therapy and for nilotinib the patient is not in blast crisis.3. Continuing treatment for second and third line treatmentAll continuing applications are to be written and must include a pathology report demonstrating the patient has responded to PBS-subsidised treatment as follows:(i) within 18 months of the commencement of treatment, at which time patients in whom a major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% has been demonstrated may receive authorisation for a further 12 months of treatment; and(ii) at no greater than 12 month intervals thereafter, to demonstrate that the major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% has been sustained.During second line continuing treatment beyond the initial 18 month treatment period, switching between approved second line TKI agents may only occur for reason of intolerance. Where there is failure of response, switching may only occur through application for prescription of a third line agent.4. Authority approval requirements.Response criteria to initial treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib:For the purposes of assessing response to PBS-subsidised treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib, either cytogenetic analysis indicating the number of Philadelphia positive [t (9;22)] cells in the bone marrow measured by standard karyotyping, or quantitative PCR indicating the relative level of BCR-ABL transcript in the peripheral blood using the international scale, must be submitted. For bone marrow analyses, where the standard karyotyping is not informative for technical reasons, a cytogenetic analysis performed on the bone marrow by the use of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with BCR-ABL specific probe must be submitted. The cytogenetic or peripheral blood quantitative PCR analyses must be submitted within 18 months of the commencement of treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib (patients in whom a major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% is demonstrable by 18 months are eligible to receive continuing treatment with that agent).5. Definitions of response.A major cytogenetic response is defined as less than 35% Philadelphia positive bone marrow cells.A peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% on the international scale (Blood 108: 28-37, 2006) also indicates a response, at least the biological equivalent of a major cytogenetic response.6. Definitions of loss of response.Loss of a previously documented major cytogenetic response (demonstrated by the presence of greater than 35% Ph positive cells on bone marrow biopsy), during ongoing tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.Loss of a previously demonstrated molecular response (demonstrated by peripheral blood BCR-ABL levels increasing consecutively in value by at least 5 fold to a level of greater than 0.1% confirmed on a subsequent test), during ongoing tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

22058	TREATMENT OF PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH UNCONTROLLED SEVERE ALLERGIC ASTHMAPatients are eligible to commence an 'omalizumab treatment cycle' (initial treatment course with or without continuing treatment course/s) if they satisfy the eligibility criteria as detailed under the initial treatment restriction.Once a patient has either failed to achieve or maintain a response to omalizumab, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 6 month break in PBS-subsidised omalizumab therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The length of a treatment break is measured from the date the most recent treatment with PBS-subsidised omalizumab treatment is stopped to the date of the first application for initial treatment with omalizumab under the new treatment cycle.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.(1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised omalizumab therapy.(a) Initial treatment:Applications for initial treatment should be made where a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised omalizumab treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy.All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 28 weeks of therapy for omalizumab.(b) Continuing treatment:Following the completion of the initial treatment course with omalizumab, a patient may qualify to receive up to a further 24 weeks of continuing treatment with omalizumab providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing omalizumab treatment in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.(2) Baseline measurements to determine response:The Department of Human Services will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ; 5 item version) or ACQ-IA, systemic corticosteroid dose and time-adjusted exacerbation rate, submitted with the Initial authority application for omalizumab. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements when a new Initial treatment authority application is submitted and The Department of Human Services will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.(3) Re-commencement of treatment after a 6 month break in PBS-subsidised therapy:A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised omalizumab therapy of at least 6 months, must re-qualify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity (systemic corticosteroid dose, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) score or ACQ-IA, and relevant exacerbation history). Patients must have received optimised standard therapy, at adequate doses and for the minimum period specified, immediately prior to the time the new baseline assessments are performed.(4) Monitoring of patients:Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following first or subsequent administration of omalizumab (see Product Information). Patients should be monitored post-injection, and medications for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should be available for immediate use following administration of omalizumab. Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur.

24253	The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) agents for the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Where the term TKI agent appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to imatinib mesilate, dasatinib or nilotinib.Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only one TKI agent at any one time and must not be receiving concomitant interferon alfa therapy. Eligible patients may only swap between TKI agents if they have not failed prior PBS-subsidised treatment with that agent.1. Initial First-line treatment From 1 April 2012, under the PBS, a patient will be able to be prescribed any of imatinib mesilate, dasatinib or nilotinib within the initial 18 month treatment period, as long as only one agent is used at a time and providing the patient has not failed to respond to any one of these TKIs.During the initial 18 month treatment period, switching between approved first-line agents may only occur for reasons of intolerance, not failure to respond2. Continuing First-line treatmentPatients must maintain a major cytogenetic response or have a peripheral blood BCR-ABL of less than 1% to receive continuing therapy.For imatinib mesilate:First continuing applications may be made by telephoning the Department of Human Services on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).For dasatinib or nilotinib:First continuing applications are to be written and must include a pathology report demonstrating the patient has responded to the initial course of treatment.Second and subsequent authority applications for continuing therapy may be made by telephoning the Department of Human Services on 1800 700 270 (hours of operation 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday to Friday).During continuing therapy beyond the initial 18 month treatment period, switching between approved first-line agents may only occur for reason of intolerance. Where there is failure to respond, switching may only occur through application for prescription of second-line agents.Where a patient has previously received PBS-subsidised treatment with imatinib mesilate, dasatinib or nilotinib no approval will be granted for PBS-subsidised re-treatment in the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia, where that patient has at any time failed to meet the response criteria whilst on that TKI agent.3. Authority approval requirements.Response criteria to initial first-line treatment with imatinib mesilate, dasatinib or nilotinib:For the purposes of assessing response to PBS-subsidised treatment with imatinib mesilate, dasatinib or nilotinib either cytogenetic analysis indicating the number of Philadelphia positive [t (9;22)] cells in the bone marrow measured by standard karyotyping, or quantitative PCR indicating the relative level of BCR-ABL transcript in the peripheral blood using the international scale, must be submitted. For bone marrow analyses, where the standard karyotyping is not informative for technical reasons, a cytogenetic analysis performed on the bone marrow by the use of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with BCR-ABL specific probe must be submitted. The cytogenetic or peripheral blood quantitative PCR analyses must be submitted within 18 months of the commencement of treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib (patients in whom a major cytogenetic response or peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% is demonstrable by 18 months are eligible to receive continuing treatment with that agent).4. Definitions of responseA major cytogenetic response is defined as less than 35% Philadelphia positive bone marrow cells.A peripheral blood BCR-ABL level of less than 1% on the international scale (Blood 108: 28-37, 2006) also indicates a response, at least the biological equivalent of a major cytogenetic response.5. Definitions of loss of responseLoss of a previously documented major cytogenetic response (demonstrated by the presence of greater than 35% Ph positive cells on bone marrow biopsy), during ongoing tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.Loss of a previously demonstrated molecular response (demonstrated by peripheral blood BCR-ABL levels increasing consecutively in value by at least 5 fold to a level of greater than 0.1% confirmed on a subsequent test), during ongoing tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

24357	TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE PSORIATIC ARTHRITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological medicines adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab,tofacitinib and ustekinumab for adult patients with severe active psoriatic arthritis. Therefore, where the term 'biological medicine' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, tofacitinib and ustekinumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological medicines at any 1 time.A patient receiving PBS-subsidised treatment for psoriatic arthritis is able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial biological medicines without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate biological medicine. Under these arrangements, within a single cycle, a patient may receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine as long as they sustain a response to therapy.A patient who received PBS-subsidised adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab or ustekinumab treatment prior to 1 May 2019 is considered to start their first cycle as of 1 May 2019.Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than once. Therefore, once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological medicine, they must change to an alternate biological medicine if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.Serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, is not considered as a treatment failure.Once a patient has either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible to commence another cycle [further details are under '(5) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy' below].The duration of the break in therapy will be measured from the date the last prescription for PBS-subsidised treatment was approved in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 biological medicines in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years may commence a new treatment cycle under Initial 3 treatment restriction.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 biological medicines in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle under Initial 2 treatment restriction.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment for severe active psoriatic arthritis.(1) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has not received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 - New patient); or(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy (initial or continuing) and wishes to trial an alternate medicine (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years with the same medicine (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of less than 5 years).(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years (Initial 3 - Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years) orAn application for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab secukinumab and tofacitinib, 18 to 20 weeks of therapy for certolizumab pegol (depending upon the dosing regimen), 20 weeks of therapy for ixekizumab, 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab, and 28 weeks of therapy for ustekinumab. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of PBS-subsidised initial treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and conducted no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of the treatment course. If the response assessment is not submitted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.Grandfather patients (ixekizumab only).A patient who commenced treatment with ixekizumab for severe psoriatic arthritis prior to 1 March 2019 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the 'Grandfather' treatment restriction.A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this restriction once. A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this criterion. Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further subsidised treatment must be prescribed under the continuing treatment restriction of the relevant drug. 'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle.For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must qualify for continuing treatment under the criteria that apply to a continuing patient.Grandfather patients (tofacitinib only).A patient who commenced treatment with Tofacitinib for severe psoriatic arthritis prior to 1 May 2019 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the 'Grandfather' treatment restriction.A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this restriction once. A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this criterion. Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further subsidised treatment must be prescribed under the continuing treatment restriction of the relevant drug. 'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle.For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must qualify for continuing treatment under the criteria that apply to a continuing patient.(2) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to the Department of Human Services where applicable. Where a response assessment is not submitted where applicable, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.Infliximab and etanercept only:For the first continuing treatment course of PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and no later than 4 weeks from the completion of the most recent course of treatment under the Initial 1 or Initial 2 treatment restrictions.For the second and subsequent continuing courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment, it is recommended that an assessment of a patient's response is conducted following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and no later than 4 weeks from the completion of the most recent course of treatment.(3) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to re-qualify with respect to either the indices of disease severity (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and active joint count) or the prior non-biological therapy requirements, except if the patient has had a break in therapy of more than 5 years who would need to requalify under the Initial 3 treatment restriction with respect to the indices of disease severity.A patient who is not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological medicine at the time of the application.However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same treatment cycle.Within a treatment cycle a patient may alternate between therapy with any biological medicine of their choice (1 at a time) providing:(i) they have not received PBS-subsidised treatment with that particular biological medicine previously; or(ii) they have demonstrated an adequate response to that particular biological medicine if they have previously trialled it on the PBS; and(iii) they have not previously failed to respond to treatment 3 times in this treatment cycle with that biological medicine.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment.(4) Baseline measurements to determine response.The Department of Human Services will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the indices of disease severity submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial or change or recommencement treatment application is submitted within a treatment cycle and these revised baseline measurements will be used to assess response to the PBS-subsidised treatment.To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline at the commencement of treatment with each initial treatment application must be used to determine response for all subsequent continuing treatments. Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be used to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. 20 or more active joints), response will be determined according to a reduction in the total number of active joints.(5) Re-commencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent course of treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must qualify under Initial 3 treatment restriction according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity. The application must include a joint count and ESR and/or CRP measurement that is no more than one month old at the time of application.

24594	TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab, etanercept and tocilizumab for a patient who has severe active juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Where the term 'biological medicine' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, etanercept and tocilizumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 3 biological medicines at any one time.From 1 April 2014, a patient receiving PBS-subsidised biological medicine is considered to be in a treatment cycle where they may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to experience a disease flare. Under these interchangeability arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may:(i) continue to receive long-term treatment with a PBS-subsidised biological medicine while they continue to show a response to therapy; and(ii) fail to respond or to sustain a response to each PBS-subsidised biological medicine once only. Therefore, once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological medicine, they must change to an alternate biological medicine if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment. Serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, is not considered as a treatment failure.Once a patient has either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 12 month break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible to commence another cycle.The length of a treatment break is measured from the date the most recent treatment with PBS-subsidised biological medicine was approved to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological medicine immediately prior to 1 April 2014 is considered to be in their first cycle as of 1 April 2014. A patient who has had a break in biological medicine treatment of at least 12 months immediately prior to making a new application, on or after 1 April 2014, will commence a new treatment cycle under the Initial 3 treatment restriction.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of a biological medicine in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 12 months may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle under the Initial 2 treatment restriction.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of a biological medicine in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 12 months must commence a new treatment cycle under the Initial 3 treatment restriction.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment therapy after 1 April 2014.(1) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has not received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 - New patient); or(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy (initial or continuing) and wishes to trial an alternate medicine (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine therapy of less than 12 months) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 12 months with the same medicine (initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine therapy of less than 12 months).(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 12 months (initial 3 - Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 12 months)Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy.A patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and conducted no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of the treatment course. If the response assessment is not conducted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.For the second and subsequent cycles of PBS-subsidised biological medicine, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the 4 weeks prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to the Department of Human Services no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.(2) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to the Department of Human Services where applicable. Where a response assessment is not submitted, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(3) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (joint count) or the prior non-biological medicine therapy requirements, except if the patient has had a break in therapy of more than 12 months who would then need to requalify under the initial 3 restrictions with respect to the indices of disease severity.A patient who is not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological medicine at the time of the application.However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same treatment cycle.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate biological medicine should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the biological medicine the patient is ceasing.(4) Baseline measurements to determine response.The Department of Human Services will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the joint count submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine. However, prescribers may provide a new baseline measurement any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and the Department of Human Services will assess response according to the revised baseline measurement.(5) Recommencement of treatment after a 12 months break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 12 months, must qualify under the initial 3 restriction and meet the relevant criteria and index of disease severity.(6) Withdrawal of treatment after sustained remission.Withdrawal of treatment with biological medicine should be considered in a patient who has achieved and sustained complete remission of disease for 12 months. A demonstration of response to the current treatment should be submitted to the Department of Human Services at the time treatment is ceased.
24610	TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab, etanercept and tocilizumab for a patient over 18 years who has a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis with onset prior to the age of 18 years. Where the term 'biological medicine' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, etanercept and tocilizumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 3 biological medicines at any one time.From 1 April 2014, a patient receiving PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy is considered to be in a treatment cycle where they may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to experience a disease flare.

The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to the Department of Human Services where applicable. Where a response assessment is not submitted, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(3) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (joint count and ESR/CRP) or the prior non- biological medicine therapy requirements, except if the patient has had a break in therapy of more than 24 months who would then need to requalify under the Initial 3 restrictions with respect to the indices of disease severity.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological medicine at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same treatment cycle.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.To avoid confusion, an application for a patient who wishes to swap to an alternate biological medicine should be accompanied by the approved authority prescription or remaining repeats for the biological medicine the patient is ceasing.(3) Baseline measurements to determine response.The Department of Human Services will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the joint count submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine. However, prescribers may provide a new baseline measurement any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and the Department of Human Services will assess response according to the revised baseline measurement.(4) Recommencement of treatment after a 24 months break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 24 months, must qualify under the Initial 3 restriction and meet the relevant criteria and index of disease severity.
24626	Increased maximum quantity will be authorised where a patient's weight is greater than 125 kg.
24661	Increased maximum quantity will be authorised where a patient requires a new loading dose due to a break in therapy of more than 1 week but less than 6 weeks from the last dose or a patient's weight is greater than 125 kg.
24733	Pharmaceutical benefits that have the form capsule 250 mg are equivalent for the purposes of substitution.
24734	TREATMENT OF PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CROHN DISEASE The following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for paediatric patients with adalimumab for severe refractory Crohn disease and infliximab for moderate to severe refractory Crohn disease. Where the term "biological medicines" appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab and infliximab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only one PBS-subsidised biological medicine at any one time. For paediatric patients with Crohn disease, infliximab is PBS-subsidised for moderate to severe disease while adalimumab is PBS-subsidised for severe disease.From 1 August 2015, under the PBS, patients commencing on adalimumab will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised biological medicine without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to infliximab. Patients on infliximab will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised biological medicine but will need to meet a PCDAI score of greater than or equal to 40 when swapping to adalimumab. Under these arrangements, within a single treatment cycle and depending on the disease severity, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine while they continue to show a response to therapy.A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment prior to 1 August 2015 is considered to have started their treatment cycle as of 1 August 2015.Within the same treatment cycle, a paediatric patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than twice.Once a patient has either failed, or ceased to respond to treatment for this condition 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy for this condition before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of biological medicine therapy in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.A patient who has failed 3 trials or fewer of biological medicine therapy in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years may commence a new treatment cycle.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.(1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy after 1 August 2015.(a) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy - Initial 1 (new patient); or(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) biological medicine therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent - Initial 2 (Change or Re-commencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years ) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent - Initial 2 (Change or Re-commencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years ); or(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years - Initial 3 (Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years).Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and 14 weeks of therapy for infliximab.From 1 August 2015, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised biological therapy following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab, and this assessment must be submitted to the Department of Human Services no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.Where a response assessment is not submitted to the Department of Human Services within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.For first and subsequent continuing courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that where required an application is submitted to the Department of Human Services no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.Adalimumab only: Two completed authority prescriptions should be submitted with every initial application for this drug. One prescription should be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats and the second prescription should be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats for patients weighing 40 kg or greater. For patients weighing less than 40 kg, one prescription should be written for 2 doses of 40 mg with no repeats and the second prescription should be written for 2 doses of 20 mg with 3 repeats.(b) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient remains eligible to receive up to 24 weeks per course of continuing treatment under the First continuing treatment and Subsequent Continuing treatment restrictions with that drug providing they continue to sustain the response.It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted supply of treatment.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be conducted within 1 month of the last dose. Where a response assessment is not conducted within the required timeframe, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(2) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy is approved, a patient with severe disease may swap if eligible to the alternate biological medicine within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) Score, confirmation of Crohn disease), or the prior conventional therapies of corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive therapy or enteral nutrition. Patients on infliximab may swap to adalimumab within the same treatment cycle provided that their disease severity has progressed to severe disease (i.e. they have a current PCDAI score of 40 or more).A patient cannot swap to a biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug twice within the same treatment cycle.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.A patient who is not able to complete an initial treatment course for a biological medicine will be deemed to have failed treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(3) Baseline measurements to determine response.The Department of Human Services will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the PCDAI submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and the Department of Human Services will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline must be used to assess response to all subsequent treatments.(4) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to recommence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity under the Initial 3 restriction. A retrial of conventional therapies is not required.

Under these arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine while they continue to show a response to therapy.A patient who received PBS-subsidised treatment with a biological medicine prior to 1 September 2017 is considered to have started their treatment cycle as of 1 September 2017.Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than once.Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment for this condition 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy for this condition before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of biological medicine therapy in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years, may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of biological medicine therapy in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.(1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised adalimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab or ustekinumab therapy after 1 September 2017.(a) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy Initial 1 (new patient); or(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) biological medicine and wishes to trial an alternate agent - Initial 2 (change or recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent - Initial 2 (change or recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years); or(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years - Initial 3 (recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years).From 1 September 2017, a patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy for adalimumab or ustekinumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab or vedolizumab, and this assessment must be submitted to the Department of Human Services no later than 4 weeks from the date that course was ceased.Where a response assessment is not submitted to the Department of Human Services within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.For subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that where required an application is submitted to the Department of Human Services no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.Adalimumab only: Two completed authority prescriptions should be submitted with every initial application for this drug. One prescription should be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats and the second prescription should be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats for patients weighing 40 kg or greater. For patients weighing less than 40 kg, one prescription should be written for 2 doses of 40 mg with no repeats and the second prescription should be written for 2 doses of 20 mg with 3 repeats.Ustekinumab only: Two completed authority prescriptions should be submitted with every initial application for this drug. One prescription should be written under S100 (Highly Specialised Drugs) for a weight-based loading dose, containing a quantity of up to 4 vials of 130 mg and no repeats. The second prescription should be written under S85 (General) for the subsequent first dose, containing a quantity of 2 vials of 45 mg and no repeats.(b) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted supply of treatment.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be conducted within 4 weeks of the last dose. Where a response assessment is not conducted within the required timeframe, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(2) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy is approved, a patient may swap if eligible to the alternate biological medicine within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score, confirmation of Crohn disease), or the prior conventional therapies of corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological medicine at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug once within the same treatment cycle.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.A patient who is not able to complete an initial treatment course for a biological medicine will be deemed to have failed treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(3) Baseline measurements to determine response.The Department of Human Services will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the CDAI or evidence of intestinal inflammation submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and the Department of Human Services will assess response according to these revised baseline measurements.To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline must be used to assess response to all subsequent treatments.(4) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to recommence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify for initial treatment with respect to the indices of disease severity under the Initial 3 restriction. A re-trial of systemic therapy is not required.

24854	TREATMENT OF PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE ULCERATIVE COLITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for paediatric patients with infliximab or adalimumab for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis; and infliximab for acute severe ulcerative colitis. Where the term 'biological medicine' appears in the following NOTES and restrictions, it refers to infliximab and adalimumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 2 biological medicines at any one time.From 1 June 2017, under the PBS, all paediatric patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial each PBS-subsidised biological medicine without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to the alternate agent. Under these arrangements, within a single treatment cycle and depending on the disease severity, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine while they continue to show a response to therapy. A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment prior to 1 June 2017 is considered to have started their treatment cycle as of 1 June 2017. Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than twice. Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.Serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, is not considered as a treatment failure.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of a biological medicine in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle under the Initial 2 treatment restriction.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of a biological medicine in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years may commence a new treatment cycle under the Initial 3 treatment restriction.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy after 1 June 2017.(1) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has not received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment and wishes to commence such therapy - Initial 1 treatment (new patient); or,(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy (initial or continuing) and wishes to trial an alternate agent - Initial 2 treatment (Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine therapy of less than 5 years ) [further details are under 'Swapping treatment' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy with the same agent - Initial 2 treatment (Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years ); or(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years (Initial 3 - recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years).Treatment authorisations under Initial 1, Initial 2 and Initial 3 will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of treatment for adalimumab and 14 weeks of treatment for infliximab. From 1 June 2017, a patient must be assessed for response to a course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for infliximab. For the second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment.Adalimumab only:Two completed authority prescriptions should be submitted with every initial application for this drug. For patients weighing 40 kg or greater, one prescription should be for the induction pack containing a quantity of 6 doses of 40 mg and no repeats and the second prescription should be written for 2 doses of 40 mg and 2 repeats. For patients weighing less than 40 kg, one prescription should be written for 2 doses of 40 mg with no repeats and the second prescription should be written for 2 doses of 20 mg with 3 repeats.(2) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient remains eligible to receive up to 24 weeks per course of continuing treatment with that drug under the continuing treatment restriction providing they continue to sustain the response. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure PBS subsidy criteria are met.(3) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) Score, confirmation of ulcerative colitis disease), or the prior conventional therapies of corticosteroids or immunosuppressives.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving treatment (initial or continuing) at the time of the application. However, a patient cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug twice within the same treatment cycle. To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these swapping arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment.(4) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to recommence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify under Initial 3 treatment restriction and meet the relevant criteria with respect to theindices of disease severity.
24855	TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE ULCERATIVE COLITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab and vedolizumab for adult patients with ulcerative colitis. Patients are eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with either adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab or vedolizumab at any one time.Where the term 'biological medicine' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab and vedolizumab only.From 1 June 2018, under the PBS, all adult patients will be able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial PBS-subsidised biological medicine without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to one of the alternate agents. Under these arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a PBS subsidised biological medicine while they continue to show a response to therapy.A patient who received PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment prior to 1 June 2018 is considered to start their first cycle as of 1 June 2018. Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than once. Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last approval for PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a PBS-subsidised biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.Serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, is not considered as a treatment failure.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of a biological medicine in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle under the Initial 2 treatment restriction.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of a biological medicine in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years, may commence a new treatment cycle under the Initial 3 treatment restrictions.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment after 1 June 2018.(1) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) an adult patient has not received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 - New patient ); or(ii) an adult patient has received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy (initial or continuing) and wishes to trial an alternate medicine (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine therapy of less than 5 years) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) an adult patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years with the same agent (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine therapy of less than 5 years); or(iv) an adult patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years (Initial 3 - recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years).Treatment authorisations under Initial 1, Initial 2 and Initial 3 will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab, 14 weeks of therapy for golimumab, infliximab and vedolizumab.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment for adalimumab and up to 12 weeks after the first dose (6 weeks following the third dose) for golimumab, infliximab and vedolizumab. For the second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment.(2) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.(3) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine treatment within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. Mayo clinic score or partial Mayo clinic score), or the prior corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine treatment at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug once within the same treatment cycle.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment.(4) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 5 years, must requalify under Initial 3 treatment restriction and meet the relevant criteria with respect to the scores of disease severity.

24994	TREATMENT OF ADULT AND ADOLESCENT PATIENTS WITH UNCONTROLLED SEVERE EOSINOPHILIC OR ALLERGIC ASTHMAThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological medicines benralizumab and mepolizumab for adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma; and omalizumab for adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma. Therefore, where the term 'biological medicine' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to benralizumab, mepolizumab and omalizumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological medicines at any 1 time.A patient receiving PBS-subsidised treatment for uncontrolled severe eosinophilic or allergic asthma is able to commence a treatment cycle where they may trial a biological medicine without having to experience a disease flare when swapping to an alternate biological medicine within the same treatment cycle.Under these arrangements, within a treatment cycle, a patient may receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine as long as they sustain a response to therapy.A patient currently receiving PBS-subsidised treatment as of 1 December 2019 is considered to have started a cycle of treatment.A patient who failed to achieve an adequate response to their last prior treatment with a biological medicine and ceased that treatment prior to 1 May 2019 is considered to be starting a new cycle of treatment from 1 December 2019 onwards if treatment with a biological medicine recommences.With the exception of the patient where omalizumab is the only suitable biological medicine treatment option, a patient who failed to achieve an adequate response to prior treatment with a biological medicine and ceased treatment between 1 May 2019 and 1 December 2019 may commence treatment with another biological medicine, but not the same biological medicine they've failed treatment with. The patient is considered to be continuing a treatment cycle with 1 treatment failure as a carry-over. For the omalizumab patient where treatment with mepolizumab and benralizumab are not suitable treatment options, a 6-month break must be observed before a re-trial of omalizumab.Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than once.Therefore, once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological medicine, they must change to an alternate biological medicine if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.Once a patient has either failed to achieve or sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a single treatment cycle. They must have at least a 12-month break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible to recommence another new treatment cycle [further details are under 'Recommencement of treatment after a treatment break in PBS-subsidised therapy' below].In patients whom omalizumab is the only appropriate treatment option for uncontrolled severe allergic asthma, once they have either failed to achieve or sustain a response to treatment with the biological medicine, they are deemed to have completed a single treatment cycle. They must have at least a 6-month break in PBS-subsidised omalizumab therapy before they are eligible to recommence a new treatment cycle with omalizumab.The length of the break in therapy is measured from the date the most recent treatment with a PBS-subsidised biological medicine is ceased until the date of the first application for recommencement of treatment with a biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles that a patient may undertake in their lifetime.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment for uncontrolled severe eosinophilic or allergic asthma.(1) Initial treatment:Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has not received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 restriction); or(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised treatment with a biological medicine and wishes to recommence a new treatment cycle with this biological medicine following a treatment break in PBS-subsidised therapy (Initial 1 restriction); or(iii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy and wishes to trial an alternate biological medicine within the same treatment cycle (Initial 2 restriction) - [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below].All applications for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of up to 32 weeks of therapy of a biological medicine. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.(2) Continuing treatment:Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological medicine providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.(3) Baseline measurements to determine response:Baseline measurements of the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ; 5 item version) or oral corticosteroid dose submitted with the Initial authority application for a biological medicine must be used to determine whether an adequate response to treatment has been achieved or sustained.For patients transitioned from the paediatric to the adolescent/adult restriction, the exacerbation history may also be used to determine response.However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements when a new Initial treatment authority application is submitted and these new baseline measurements may be used to assess response.(4) Swapping therapy within the same treatment cycle.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine at any time by qualifying under an Initial 2 restriction.However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same treatment cycle.Within the same treatment cycle a patient may alternate between therapy with any biological medicine of their choice (1 at a time) providing:(i) they have not received PBS-subsidised treatment with that particular biological medicine previously; or(ii) they have demonstrated an adequate response to that particular biological medicine if they have previously trialled it on the PBS; and(iii) they have not previously failed to respond to treatment with all 3 biological medicines in this treatment cycle.(5) Re-commencement of a new treatment cycle after a treatment break in PBS-subsidised therapy:A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent new treatment cycle, following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of at least 6 months (in patients where omalizumab is the only appropriate treatment option for uncontrolled severe allergic asthma) or 12 months (in patients who have failed to achieve or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times within a treatment cycle), must re-qualify through an Initial 1 restriction.(6) Monitoring of patients:Omalizumab only:Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following first or subsequent administration of omalizumab (see Product Information). Patients should be monitored post-injection, and medications for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should be available for immediate use following administration of omalizumab. Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur.

25771	TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological medicines for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Where the term biological medicine appears in the following notes and restrictions it refers to the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alfa antagonists (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab), the interleukin-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab), the T-cell co-stimulation modulator (abatacept) and the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (baricitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib).A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological medicines at any 1 time.In order to be eligible to receive PBS-subsidised treatment with rituximab, a patient must have already failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 course of treatment with a PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist.A patient receiving PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to experience a disease flare. Under these interchangeability arrangements:- a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a PBS-subsidised biological medicine while they continue to show a response to therapy,- a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than once, and- once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 5 times, they will not be eligible to receive further PBS-subsidised biological medicines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.A serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Stevens Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, is not considered a treatment failure.A patient whose most recent course of PBS-subsidised therapy was with rituximab and whose response to this treatment is sustained for more than 12 months, may apply for a further course of rituximab under the Continuing treatment restriction.A patient who has failed fewer than 5 biological medicines and who has a break in treatment of less than 24 months may commence a further course of treatment with a biological medicine under Initial 2 treatment restriction. A patient who has failed fewer than 5 biological medicines and who has had a break in therapy of longer than 24 months may commence a further course of treatment with a biological medicine under the Initial 3 treatment restriction. The length of a treatment break is measured from the date the most recent treatment with PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment is stopped to the date of the new application for treatment with a biological medicine.(1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy after 1 April 2019.(a) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment and wishes to commence such therapy, excluding rituximab (Initial 1 - new patient); or(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) biological medicine therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2 - change or re-commencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of less than 24 months) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break of less than 24 months in PBS-subsidised therapy with that agent (Initial 2 - change or re-commencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of less than 24 months).(iv) a patient wishes to re-commence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 24 months (Initial 3 - re-commencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 24 months)Initial applications for a new patient (Initial 1) must include a joint count and ESR and/or CRP measured at the completion of the 6-month intensive DMARD trial, but prior to ceasing DMARD therapy.Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for abatacept, adalimumab, baricitinib, etanercept, golimumab, tocilizumab, tofacitinib and upadacitinib, 18 to 20 weeks of therapy with certolizumab pegol (depending upon the dosing regimen), 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab and 2 infusions of rituximab.Rituximab patients should be assessed following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion, and the assessment should be submitted to Services Australia within 4 weeks to ensure continuity of treatment for those who meet the continuing restriction for PBS subsidised treatment with this drug for this condition.Where a response assessment is not provided the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment. For second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine (excluding rituximab) treatment, it is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the month prior to completing their current course of treatment and that where required an application is submitted to Services Australia within sufficient time to allow processing.Abatacept patients:A patient is eligible to receive one I.V. loading dose when commencing treatment with the subcutaneous formulation. Two prescriptions are required, the first prescription for the I.V. loading dose for sufficient vials for one dose based on the patient's weight with no repeats. The second prescription for the subcutaneous formulation, with a maximum quantity of 4 and up to 3 repeats, must be submitted with the initial application.Rituximab patients:A further application may be submitted to Services Australia within sufficient time to allow processing. New baselines may be submitted with this application if appropriate.(b) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine (excluding rituximab), a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.Assessment of the patient's response to treatment must be conducted following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of the most recent course of biological medicine therapy.Rituximab patients:A patient may qualify to receive a further course of treatment (every 24 weeks) with this agent providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks after the first infusion of their most recent treatment with rituximab. The patient remains eligible to receive a course of rituximab every 24 weeks providing they continue to demonstrate a response as specified in the restriction. Where a response assessment is not conducted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine.(2) Swapping therapyOnce initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the joint count) or the prior non- biological medicine therapy requirements except if the patient has had a break in therapy of more than 24 months who would need to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity. However the requirement for concomitant treatment with methotrexate, where it applies, must be met for each biological medicine trialled.A patient who is not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that agent, unless they have experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity necessitating permanent treatment withdrawal.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological medicine at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug.Abatacept:A patient swapping from I.V. abatacept to subcutaneous abatacept will not be eligible for an I.V. loading dose when commencing treatment with the subcutaneous formulation.Rituximab:In order to trial rituximab, a patient must have trialled and failed to demonstrate a response to at least 1 PBS-subsidised TNF-alfa antagonist treatment.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under the interchangeability arrangements, it is important that they be assessed for response to every course of treatment, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.PBS subsidy does not allow for patients to receive treatment with another PBS-subsidised biological medicine during the required treatment-free period applying to patients who have demonstrated a response to their most recent course of rituximab. This means that patients who have demonstrated a response to a course of rituximab must have a PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy treatment-free period of at least 22 weeks, immediately following the second infusion, before swapping to an alternate biological medicine. Patients who fail to respond to rituximab and who qualify and wish to trial a course of an alternate biological medicine may do so without having to have any treatment-free period.(3) Baseline measurements to determine response.Determination of whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated must be based on the baseline measurements of the joint count, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine. However, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an initial treatment authority application is submitted and the eligibility for continuing treatment must be assessed according to these revised baseline measurements.To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline must be used for all subsequent continuing treatment applications. Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be used to determine response. Similarly, where the baseline active joint count is based on total active joints (i.e. more than 20 active joints), response must be determined according to the reduction in the total number of active joints. Where the baseline is determined on total number of major joints, the response must be determined on the total number of major joints.Applications under the Initial 1 treatment restriction for a new patient must include a joint count and ESR and/or CRP measured at the completion of the 6 month intensive DMARD trial, but prior to ceasing DMARD therapy. The results must be no more than 4 weeks old at the time of application.Applications under the Initial 3 treatment restriction for re-commencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 24 months must include a joint count and ESR and/or CRP measurement that is no more than one month old at the time of application.

25935	TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH NON-RADIOGRAPHIC AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of certolizumab pegol and golimumab for adult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyoarthritis.Where the term 'biological medicine' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to certolizumab pegol and golimumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 2 biological medicines at any one time.Under these arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine while they continue to show or sustain a response to therapy.A serious adverse reaction requiring permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, is not considered a treatment failure.Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than twice.Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times (twice with the same biological medicine, once with another biological medicine) within the same treatment cycle, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last prescription for PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 trials of biological medicine therapy in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.A patient who has failed 3 trials or fewer of biological medicine therapy in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years may commence a new treatment cycle.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment with certolizumab pegol and golimumab:(1) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 - New patient)(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) biological medicine therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years); or(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years (Initial 3 - Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years).With the exception of grandfathered patients, a patient must be assessed for response to a course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.(2) Continuing treatment.For continuing courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine it is recommended that a patient be reviewed the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that biological medicine provided they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment in courses of up to 24 weeks provided they continue to sustain an adequate response.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be conducted no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course. Where a response assessment is not conducted within the required timeframe, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction requiring permanent treatment withdrawal.(3) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the C-reactive protein (CRP) level and the BASDAI score), or the prior NSAID therapy and exercise program requirements.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment.A patient who is not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction requiring permanent treatment withdrawal.(4) Baseline measurements to determine response.A response to treatment is based on the baseline BASDAI score and CRP level documented in the patient's medical records.For a new patient, the BASDAI score used to determine baseline disease severity must be measured while the patient is receiving NSAID therapy and completing their exercise program.To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline must be used for all subsequent continuing treatment applications.Prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time that an 'Initial treatment' authority application is submitted and the eligibility for continuing treatment must be assessed according to these revised baseline measurements.(5) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 5 years, must qualify under the Initial 3 treatment restriction. The same clinical criteria and indices of disease severity (i.e. the C-reactive protein (CRP) level and the BASDAI score) as for the Initial 1 (New patient) restriction will need to be met, but a re-trial of NSAID therapy and exercise therapy is not required.

26200	TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACTIVE SYSTEMIC JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of tocilizumab for a patient who has severe active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).From 1 May 2012, a patient receiving PBS-subsidised tocilizumab therapy is considered to be in a treatment cycle. Under these arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may:(i) continue to receive long-term treatment with PBS-subsidised tocilizumab while they continue to show an adequate response to therapy, and(ii) fail to respond, or to sustain a response, to PBS-subsidised tocilizumab twice.Once a patient has either failed or ceased to sustain an adequate response to 2 courses of treatment, they are deemed to have completed a single treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 12 month break in PBS-subsidised tocilizumab therapy before they are eligible to commence another cycle. The length of a treatment break is measured from the date the most recent treatment with PBS-subsidised tocilizumab treatment was approved to the date of the first application for initial treatment with tocilizumab under the new treatment cycle.A serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, will not be considered as a treatment failure.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised tocilizumab treatment therapy after 1 May 2012.(1) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has not received prior PBS-subsidised tocilizumab treatment and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 - New patient); or(ii) a patient has received the first course of PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) tocilizumab therapy in a treatment cycle and is deemed to have failed to respond or sustain an adequate response and the treating physician wishes to trial a second course, provided any break in therapy is less than 12 months (Initial 2 - retrial or recommencement of treatment after a break of less than 12 months); or(iii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with tocilizumab following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 12 months (Initial 2 - retrial or recommencement of treatment after a break of less than 12 months).(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised tocilizumab therapy of more than 12 months (Initial 3 - recommencement of a new treatment cycle after a break of more than 12 months).Initial treatment authorisations will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy.A patient must be assessed for response to any course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy and conducted no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of the treatment course. If the response assessment is not conducted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed this course of treatment.(2) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with tocilizumab, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with this drug provided they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing tocilizumab treatment in courses of up to 24 weeks provided they continue to sustain the response. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the 4 weeks prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted tocilizumab supply.Assessments of response to a course of PBS-subsidised therapy must be conducted after a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment and no later than 4 weeks from the completion of treatment. Where a response assessment is not conducted within these timeframes, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with tocilizumab.For the second and subsequent courses of PBS-subsidised tocilizumab, it is recommended that a patient be assessed for response in the 4 weeks prior to completing their current course of treatment and that an application is posted to Services Australia no later than 2 weeks prior to the patient completing their current treatment course.(3) Treatment cycle.Once initial treatment with PBS-subsidised tocilizumab is approved, a patient deemed to have failed to respond to the first course of treatment may have a second course without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (joint count, fever and/or CRP level and platelet count), except if the patient has had a break in therapy of more than 12 months.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment approved, within the timeframes specified in the relevant restriction.(4) Baseline measurements to determine response.Whether an adequate response to treatment has been demonstrated or not will be based on the relative change from relevant baseline measurements of the joint count, fever and/or CRP level and platelet count submitted with the first authority application for tocilizumab.Where a patient is deemed to have failed to respond or to sustain an adequate response to the first course of therapy in a treatment cycle, prescribers may provide new baseline measurements for the second course of treatment within that cycle. Assessment of response according to these revised baseline measurements may then occur. If new baseline measurements are not submitted with the initial application for the second course of treatment, then those submitted with the first course will be used to assess response to the second course.(5) Recommencement of treatment after a 12 month break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to start a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised tocilizumab therapy of at least 12 months, must requalify for treatment under the Initial 3 treatment restriction.(6) Withdrawal of treatment after sustained remission.Withdrawal of treatment with tocilizumab should be considered in a patient who has achieved and sustained complete remission of disease for 12 months. A demonstration of response to the current treatment should be submitted to Services Australia at the time treatment is ceased.

26395	TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of the biological medicines adalimumab, etanercept, guselkumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, secukinumab, tildrakizumab and ustekinumab for adult patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Therefore, where the term 'biological medicines' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, etanercept, guselkumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, secukinumab, tildrakizumab and ustekinumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the above biological medicines at any 1 time.A patient who received PBS-subsidised adalimumab, etanercept, guselkumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, secukinumab, tildrakizumab and ustekinumab treatment prior to 1 February 2019 is considered to start their first cycle as of 1 February 2019.A patient receiving PBS-subsidised treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis is able to commence a 'treatment cycle', where they may trial biological medicines without having to experience a disease flare, when swapping to an alternate biological medicine. Under these arrangements, within a single cycle, a patient may receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine as long as they sustain a response to therapy.Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than once. Therefore, once a patient fails to meet the response criteria for a PBS-subsidised biological medicine, they must change to an alternate biological medicine if they wish to continue PBS-subsidised biological treatment.Serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment, including serious infusion or injection related reactions, Steven's Johnson Syndrome, development of a demyelinating lesion, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and malignancy related to treatment with the biological medicine, is not considered as a treatment failure.A patient must be assessed for response to each course of treatment according to the criteria included in the relevant continuing treatment restriction.Once a patient has either failed or ceased to sustain a response to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle.The duration of the break in therapy will be measured from the date the last prescription for PBS-subsidised treatment was approved in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 biological medicines in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years may commence a new treatment cycle under Initial 3 treatment restriction.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 biological medicines in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle under Initial 2 treatment restriction.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment for severe chronic plaque psoriasis.There are separate restrictions for both the initial and continuing treatment for psoriasis affecting the whole body, versus psoriasis affecting the face, hands and feet.(1) Initial treatment.An application for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has not received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment for this condition and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 - New patient); or(ii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years (Initial 3 - Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years); or(iii) a patient who has received prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy for this condition (initial or continuing) and wishes to trial an alternate biological medicine (Initial 2 - Change or Re-commencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of less than 5 years) [further details are under (4) 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years with the same medicine (Initial 2 - Change or Re-commencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of less than 5 years).An application for initial treatment will be limited to provide for a maximum of 16 weeks of therapy for adalimumab, etanercept, ixekizumab and secukinumab, 20 weeks of therapy for guselkumab, 22 weeks of therapy for infliximab and 28 weeks of therapy for risankizumab, tildrakizumab and ustekinumab.It is recommended that a patient be reviewed in the 4 weeks prior to completing their course of initial treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.Grandfather patients (risankizumab only).A patient who commenced treatment with risankizumab for chronic plaque psoriasis prior to 1 December 2019 and who continues to receive treatment at the time of application, may qualify for treatment under the Initial treatment Grandfather treatment restriction.A patient may only qualify for PBS-subsidised treatment under this restriction once. A maximum of 24 weeks of treatment will be authorised under this criterion. Following completion of the initial PBS-subsidised course, further subsidised treatment must be prescribed under the continuing treatment restriction of the relevant drug. 'Grandfather' arrangements will only apply for the first treatment cycle.For the second and subsequent cycles, a 'grandfather' patient must qualify for continuing treatment under the criteria that apply to a continuing patient.(2) Assessment of response to initial treatment.When prescribing initial treatment with a biological medicine, it is recommended that a PASI assessment is conducted after at least 12 weeks of treatment. This assessment must be conducted within 4 weeks of the completion of this initial treatment course.The PASI assessment for continuing treatment must be performed on the same affected area as assessed at baseline.(3) Continuing treatment.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response. It is recommended that a patient be reviewed the 4 weeks prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be submitted to Services Australia where applicable. Where a response assessment is not submitted where applicable, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.Infliximab and etanercept only:For the first continuing treatment course of PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy under the Initial 1 or Initial 2 treatment restrictions.For second and subsequent continuing courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed in the 4 weeks prior to completing their current course of treatment.(4) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. a PASI score of greater than 15), or the prior non-biological therapy requirements, except if the patient has had a break in therapy of more than 5 years who would need to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity.A patient who is not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological medicine at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that particular biological medicine within the same cycle or have experienced treatment failure with that particular biological medicine that required permanent treatment withdrawal.To ensure patients receive the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment.(5) Baseline measurements to determine response.Services Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline PASI assessment submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine. However, prescribers may provide new baseline PASI assessments any time that an initial or change or recommencement treatment application is submitted within a treatment cycle and this revised baseline PASI score will be used to assess the patient's response to the PBS-subsidised treatment.To ensure consistency in determining response, the same body area assessed at the baseline PASI assessment must be assessed for demonstration of response to treatment for the purposes of all continuing treatments.(6) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent treatment cycle following a break in PBS-subsidised biological therapy of at least 5 years, must qualify under Initial 3 treatment according to the criteria of the relevant restriction and index of disease severity. A PASI assessment must be conducted prior to application and patient must have a PASI score of greater than 15 for whole body. For the face, hand, foot at least 2 of the 3 the PASI symptom subscores for erythema, thickness and scaling are rated as severe or very severe; or the skin area affected is 30% or more of the face, palm of a hand or sole of a foot. The PASI assessment must be no older than 4 weeks at the time of application.

26621	TREATMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITISThe following information applies to the prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab and secukinumab for adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis.Where the term 'biological medicine' appears in notes and restrictions, it refers to adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab and secukinumab only.A patient is eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with only 1 of the 7 biological medicines at any 1 time.Under these arrangements, within a single treatment cycle, a patient may continue to receive long-term treatment with a biological medicine while they continue to show a response to therapy.A patient who has been receiving PBS-subsidised adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab and secukinumab treatment prior to 1 December 2020 is considered to start their first cycle as of 1 December 2020.Within the same treatment cycle, a patient cannot trial and fail, or cease to respond to, the same PBS-subsidised biological medicine more than once.Once a patient has either failed or ceased to respond to treatment 3 times, they are deemed to have completed a treatment cycle and they must have, at a minimum, a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy before they are eligible to commence the next cycle. The 5-year break is measured from the date of the last prescription for PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in the most recent cycle to the date of the first application for initial treatment with a biological medicine under the new treatment cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 biological medicines in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of less than 5 years may commence a further course of treatment within the same treatment cycle.A patient who has failed fewer than 3 biological medicines in a treatment cycle and who has a break in therapy of more than 5 years may commence a new treatment cycle.There is no limit to the number of treatment cycles a patient may undertake in their lifetime.(1) How to prescribe PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment with adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab and secukinumab.(a) Initial treatment.Applications for initial treatment should be made where:(i) a patient has received no prior PBS-subsidised biological medicine treatment in this treatment cycle and wishes to commence such therapy (Initial 1 - New patient)(ii) a patient has received prior PBS-subsidised (initial or continuing) biological medicine therapy and wishes to trial an alternate agent (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years) [further details are under 'Swapping therapy' below]; or(iii) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a specific biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of less than 5 years with the same agent (Initial 2 - Change or Recommencement of treatment after a break in therapy of less than 5 years); or(iv) a patient wishes to recommence treatment with a biological medicine following a break in PBS-subsidised therapy of more than 5 years (Initial 3 - Recommencement of treatment after a break in biological medicine of more than 5 years).A patient must be assessed for response to a course of initial PBS-subsidised treatment following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy.(b) Continuing treatment.For the first continuing treatment course of PBS-subsidised biological medicine, it is recommended that a patient is reviewed for response following a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy under the Initial 1, Initial 2 or Initial 3 treatment restrictions. For second and subsequent continuing courses of PBS-subsidised biological medicine it is recommended that a patient be reviewed the month prior to completing their current course of treatment to ensure uninterrupted biological medicine supply.Following the completion of an initial treatment course with a specific biological medicine, a patient may qualify to receive up to 24 weeks of continuing treatment with that drug providing they have demonstrated an adequate response to treatment. The patient remains eligible to receive continuing biological medicine treatment with the same drug in courses of up to 24 weeks providing they continue to sustain the response.A patient must be assessed for response to a course of continuing therapy, and the assessment must be conducted no later than 4 weeks from the cessation of that treatment course. Where a response assessment is not conducted within the required timeframe, the patient will be deemed to have failed to respond to treatment with that biological medicine, unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(2) Swapping therapy.Once initial treatment with the first PBS-subsidised biological medicine is approved, a patient may swap to an alternate biological medicine within the same treatment cycle without having to requalify with respect to the indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the BASDAI), or the prior NSAID therapy and exercise program requirements.A patient may trial an alternate biological medicine at any time, regardless of whether they are receiving therapy (initial or continuing) with a biological medicine at the time of the application. However, they cannot swap to a particular biological medicine if they have failed to respond to prior treatment with that drug within the same treatment cycle.To ensure a patient receives the maximum treatment opportunities allowed under these arrangements, it is important that they are assessed for response to every course of treatment.A patient who is not able to complete a minimum of 12 weeks of an initial treatment course will be deemed to have failed treatment with that biological medicine unless the patient has experienced a serious adverse reaction of a severity resulting in the necessity for permanent withdrawal of treatment.(3) Baseline measurements to determine response.Services Australia will determine whether a response to treatment has been demonstrated based on the baseline measurements of the BASDAI, ESR and/or CRP submitted with the first authority application for a biological medicine.For a new patient, the BASDAI used to determine the baseline must be measured while the patient is receiving NSAID therapy and completing their exercise program.To ensure consistency in determining response, the same indices of disease severity used to establish baseline must be used for all subsequent continuing treatment applications. Therefore, where only an ESR or CRP level is provided at baseline, an ESR or CRP level respectively must be used to determine response.Prescribers may provide new baseline measurements any time an 'Initial treatment' authority application is submitted within a treatment cycle and the eligibility for continuing treatment must be assessed according to these revised baseline measurements.(4) Recommencement of treatment after a 5-year break in PBS-subsidised therapy.A patient who wishes to trial a second or subsequent course of treatment following a break in PBS-subsidised biological medicine therapy of at least 5 years, must qualify under the Initial 3 treatment restriction. The same clinical criteria and indices of disease severity (i.e. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the BASDAI) as for the Initial 1 (New patient) restriction will need to be met, but a re-trial of NSAID therapy and exercise therapy is not required.
